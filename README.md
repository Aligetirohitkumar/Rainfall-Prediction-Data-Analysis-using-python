# Project Title: Rainfall Prediction Using Advanced Data Analysis in Python

This project demonstrates advanced data analysis techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The primary objective is to analyze weather data to detect rainfall patterns. The analysis is based on the dataset austin_weather.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17919036/austin_weather.csv) and [austin_weather_final.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17919053/austin_weather_final.c
 , and the outputs are visualized through various PNG images generated during the process.

Key Details:
Dataset Used:

austin_weather.csv: The raw dataset containing weather data from Austin, Texas.
austin_weather_final.csv: The processed dataset created after cleaning and transforming the raw data for analysis.
Process Overview:

Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and inconsistencies in austin_weather.csv.
Data Transformation: Extracted relevant features and prepared austin_weather_final.csv for analysis.
Analysis: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations.
Visualizations: Created various plots and graphs to highlight key insights and trends.
Outputs:
The results of the analysis are visualized in the form of PNG images, showcasing insights into rainfall detection and related weather patterns.

This project effectively combines data processing, analysis, and visualization to derive actionable insights into rainfall detection.
