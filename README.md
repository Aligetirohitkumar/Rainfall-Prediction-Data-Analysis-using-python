# Project Title: Rainfall Prediction Using Advanced Data Analysis in Python

This project demonstrates advanced data analysis techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The primary objective is to analyze weather data to detect rainfall patterns. The analysis is based on the dataset austin_weather.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17919036/austin_weather.csv) and [austin_weather_final.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17919053/austin_weather_final.c
 , and the outputs are visualized through various PNG images generated during the process.
